## The Rust Community event list.

*This is currently just a port of [the Wiki page](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/wiki/Community-User-Groups,-Meetups,-and-Events) that we'd like to put under curation.*


*In the future, we'd like to curate that list. If you have suggestions, please [contact us](http://github.com/rustberlin) or [send a pull request](http://github.com/rustberlin/rustberlin.github.io).*

Rust has a large and growing international community. There are a number of local user groups, meetups, and events spread around the world that are friendly to people with all skill levels.
