This page is under construction.

Welcome to the Rust Berlin Community Pages. It is a resource currently managed and curated by the Rust Berlin User Group. We try to document the Rust community at large, so pull requests are welcome.

We meet weekly, at irregular days of the week, see our [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Rust-Berlin/) page for details.

Searching for a meetup in your area? Check our [global events list]({{ "/global_events.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

Searching for people willing to introduce Rust to your meetup or company? Check our [global speakers list]({{ "/speakers.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

Interested in running a user or learners group? Contact us on `#rust-community` on IRC or just send us a message on the [Issue Tracker](http://github.com/RustBerlin/rustberlin.github.io/issues).

## Getting started with Rust

Be sure to check out the [official website](http://www.rust-lang.org/)!

1. Install Rust on your machine: <http://www.rust-lang.org/install.html>
2. Work your way through [the book](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and [Rust by Example](http://rustbyexample.com/index.html)
3. Find a cool project to hack on. Here are a few suggestions:
    * Solve a problem on Project Euler
    * Ask someone at your local meetup if (s)he has a project and needs contributors (you'd be surprised how many do!)
    * Contribute to the ecosystem by writing your own library and submitting it to [Cargo](https://crates.io)
